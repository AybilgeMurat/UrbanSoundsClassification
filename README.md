# UrbanSoundsClassification
Classification of city sounds with deep learning CNN.

DATA

This dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music. The classes are drawn from the urban sound taxonomy.
The files are pre-sorted into ten folds (folders named fold1-fold10) to help in the reproduction of and comparison with the automatic classification results reported in the article above.

In addition to the sound excerpts, a CSV file containing metadata about each excerpt is also provided.
